# Python Particle Simulation
### A project to introduce myself to Python

I've used some basic mechanics to implement a small simulator for 2D circle elastic collisions. The collision function conserves momentum and energy for a realistic aesthetic. 

Two conditions must be met for an actual collision to occur.
1. The balls must be overlapping.
2. The distance between the two balls must be decreasing.

< Python code here
to demostrate these conditions>

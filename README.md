# Python Particle Simulation
### A project to introduce myself to Python

I've used some basic mechanics to implement a small simulator for 2D circle elastic collisions. The collision function conserves momentum and energy for a realistic aesthetic. 

## The Process
The most difficult issue, unrelated to familiarizing myself with the Python language, was producing collisions that did not cause glitchy  effects. I'll explain an example of a hacky, unrefined solution that I first implemented, and then I'll show my final solution.

Two conditions must be met for an actual **collision** to occur.
1. The balls must be overlapping.
2. The distance between the two balls must be decreasing.
